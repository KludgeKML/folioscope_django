folioscope_django
=================

Django-app version of Folioscope for easier deployment

The original folioscope was built for the Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project at King's College London: [http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/folioscope/](http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/folioscope/)

Because there has been some interest in reuse (and because the original version was very tightly coupled to its original website and subsystems), I have begun this version to prepare it for wider use.
